Scripts for fitting distribution models to discrete stellar profiles in FITS data.

![random fitting](./img/random_fit.png "Random Gaussian FIT")

Requires `Python 3.6+` with `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `numba`, `astropy`, `photutils`, and `scipy` installed (the easiest way to use it would probably be to install Anaconda Python 3).
